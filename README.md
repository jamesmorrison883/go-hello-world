# Go Hello World Program

This project demonstrates a basic "Hello World" program in Go, along with additional examples showcasing key Go programming concepts such as primitive data types, arrays, slices, maps, pointers, and structs.

## Features

- **Primitive Data Types**: Learn how to use Go's basic data types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `string`.
- **Arrays, Slices, and Maps**: Examples of using arrays, slices, and maps, including their differences and use cases.
- **Pointers**: Understand Go's pointer system with examples showing pointer dereferencing and memory references.
- **Structs**: Learn how to define and use structs to create custom types in Go.

## Files

- **`primitives.go`**: Contains examples of Go's primitive data types.
- **`arrays_slices_maps.go`**: Shows how to work with arrays, slices, and maps in Go.
- **`pointers.go`**: Includes examples demonstrating how to use pointers in Go.
- **`structs.go`**: Illustrates how to define and use structs in Go.
